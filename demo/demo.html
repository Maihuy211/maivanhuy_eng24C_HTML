                Cat <b>The cat (Felis catus)</b>, also referred to as <b>the domestic cat</b>, is a small domesticated
                carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. <br /> Advances in
                archaeology and
                genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is
                commonly
                kept as a pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued
                by
                humans
                for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Its retractable claws are adapted to killing small
                prey
                species such as mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its
                night
                vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a
                crepuscular
                predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations—including meowing, purring, trilling, hissing,
                growling,
                and
                grunting—as well as body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears,
                such as
                those made by small mammals. It secretes and perceives pheromones. hello word

            <h2>Etymology and naming</h2>
            <p>
                The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to be the Late Latin word cattus, which
                was
                first used at the beginning of the 6th century.[4] The Late Latin word may be derived from an
                unidentified
                African language.[5] The Nubian word kaddîska 'wildcat' and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or
                cognates.[6]
                The forms might also have derived from an ancient Germanic word that was absorbed into Latin and then
                into
                Greek, Syriac, and Arabic.[7] The word may be derived from Germanic and Northern European languages, and
                ultimately be borrowed from Uralic, cf. Northern Sámi gáđfi, 'female stoat', and Hungarian hölgy, 'lady,
                female
                stoat'; from Proto-Uralic *käďwä, 'female (of a furred animal)'.[8]
                The English puss, extended as pussy and pussycat, is attested from the 16th century and may have been
                introduced
                from Dutch poes or from Low German puuskatte, related to Swedish kattepus, or Norwegian pus, pusekatt.
                Similar
                forms exist in Lithuanian puižė and Irish puisín or puiscín. The etymology of this word is unknown, but
                it
                may
                have arisen from a sound used to attract a cat.[9][10]
                A male cat is called a tom or tomcat[11] (or a gib,[12] if neutered). A female is called a queen[13][14]
                (or
                sometimes a molly,[15] if spayed). A juvenile cat is referred to as a kitten. In Early Modern English,
                the
                word
                kitten was interchangeable with the now-obsolete word catling.[16] A group of cats can be referred to as
                a
                clowder, a glaring,[17] or a colony.[18]

            <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <h3>Size</h3>
            <p>
                The domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European wildcat.[49] It averages about
                46
                cm
                (18 in) in head-to-body length and 23–25 cm (9.1–9.8 in) in height, with about 30 cm (12 in) long tails.
                Males
                are larger than females.[50] Adult domestic cats typically weigh 4–5 kg (8.8–11.0 lb).[29]
            </p>
            <h3>Skeleton</h3>
            <p>
                Cats have seven cervical vertebrae (as do most mammals); 13 thoracic vertebrae (humans have 12); seven
                lumbar
                vertebrae (humans have five); three sacral vertebrae (as do most mammals, but humans have five); and a
                variable
                number of caudal vertebrae in the tail (humans have only three to five vestigial caudal vertebrae, fused
                into an
                internal coccyx).[51]: 11  The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's spinal mobility
                and
                flexibility. Attached to the spine are 13 ribs, the shoulder, and the pelvis.[51]: 16  Unlike human
                arms,
                cat
                forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones which allow them to pass their
                body
                through any space into which they can fit their head.[52]
